this is just a bunch of things I made a while ago

## Book directory
Script to generate a book for minecraft  
Will probably want to use a client to write it

## Discord directory
counter.py - Sends numbers to a counting channel  
myuu.py - meant for myuu bot, was gonna port over from c# but just never got around to it ig  
nuke.py - It's exactly what you think it is

## Gmod directory
Both scripts do pretty much the same thing, just made em so I could try and figure out the best weapon to use

## String directory
ascii.py - Generates a random string of characters  
password.py - Password generator  
why.py - Writes a **lot** of characters to a file

## Useful directory
anti-afk.py - Anti-afk script for games  
mass_search.py - Search through a directory's file's and looks for a key value

## Loose files
hex.py - I'm not quite sure why I made this  
image.py - No idea what this was meant to do  
large-number.py - Makes a big number and writes it to a file
